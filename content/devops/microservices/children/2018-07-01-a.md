As we did for Go and Java, where is was possible to create an Dockerfile starting from "scratch",
the goal of this post is to create a python base server container with a minimum about of packages
(debian and python) to reduce the security exposure of the container as well as the image size.

<!--more-->

## Key Aspects

- Use SCRATCH has base image to keep size minimum
- Simple HelloWorld Python web server
- Create associated HELM chart for Kubernetes deployment
- Provide deployment for both amd64 and arm32v7

## Simple Python Server

The [pythonhttpserver](https://github.com/jbrette/pythonhttpserv) repo showcases:
- How to create a simple Python3 server
- How to leverage Travis to compile for amd64 and arm32v7.
- Branch amd64 is for normal PC and HP server.
- Branch arm32v7 produces software usable on Raspberry PI 3B+
