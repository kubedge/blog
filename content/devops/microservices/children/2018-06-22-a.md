A lot of the opensource projects evolvoving around Kubernetes are written in go.
It is very usefull to be able to rebuild so projects using `go get` or `go build`.

## Installing the right version of GO

If you have strange errors, when running go get ...., chances are that your version of GO is old.
On Ubuntu, it is actually quite simple to address the issue.

If you are still running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
~~~
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go
~~~

## How to setup your GOPATH

A lot of things seems to work much better if you edit your `.bashrc` to set GOPATH=$HOME.
The advantage of such a setup is that future "go get xxx" calls, will compile the go file into $HOME/bin which means
that new executable will be available without changing your PATH.
