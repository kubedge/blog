The new Kubernetes 1.12 is out. THe goal is to update my two clusters to 1.12
using kubeadm 1.12

<!--more-->

## Master node upgrade using kubeadm

```bash
# apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
> apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm && \
> apt-mark hold kubeadm
kubeadm was already not hold.

[upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.12.0". Enjoy!

[upgrade/kubelet] Now that your control plane is upgraded, please proceed with upgrading your kubelets if you haven't already done so.

Kubernetes servers are running v1.12
```bash

Let's apply usual receipe
``bash
sudo ip link delete flannel.1
```

Brute force fix seems to have done the fix....This is lucky we don't have production traffic on that node.
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

## Update first slave node

```bash
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kubeadm
sudo apt-get install kubelet
sudo kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version $(kubelet --version | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

Same flannel issue
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

```

same hack to fix the issue
```bash

### Other slave node

```
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kubeadm
sudo apt-get install kubelet
sudo kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version $(kubelet --version | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
sudo ip link delete flannel.1
```

## Check consistency of the cluster

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

## Conclusion

- At a glance, the cluster seems to be healthy
- I still need to find sometool like sonobuoy to validate that the cluster is healthy
